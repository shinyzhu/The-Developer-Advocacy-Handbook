# The Developer Advocacy Handbook

![Chris Heilmann presenting at dotjs 2019 with a slide saying developers are people](media/README/cover.jpg)

This handbook will get you on the way to be a great developer advocate for any product or company. Naturally, your approach may need tweaking for different markets and audiences - and in accordance with your own personality - but the main principles are the same for everybody and anywhere in the world.

This is a new, 2020 version of this 11 year old book and I added quite a few new chapters and removed outdated materials. You can read more about this in the [about section](https://developer-advocacy.com/about).

Now, why not get right into it? Choose from the [table of contents](https://developer-advocacy.com/toc) or [read the book](https://developer-advocacy.com/what-is-developer-advocacy).
